# Project3- Landscapping

## Overview
A site that allows visitors to leave reviews and site administrators to delete reviews after logging in and being authenticated. 
We wanted to create a website for a Landscaping startup company in Vernal
When visitors visit the site they are allowed to create reviews
When administrators see reviews that they dont approve of they are able to login and delete undesirable reviews

This webpage uses Passport `npm passport`, that is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js. The Passport can only match a username/ID and password. Then we use `npm bcrypt` for salting and hashing a readble password to different word.
